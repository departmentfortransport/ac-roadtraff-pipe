**Warning: `TRA25rap` is the first package written by Luke Shaw, and as such may be more buggy and a pain than more professional packages**. It is based heavily on the `xltabr` package developed by members of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).
------------

If you are not a member of the Department for Transport (DfT) **I highly recommend you instead [use the `xltabr` package](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/xltabr)**, as it is a far more developed and organised package. 

Even if you do work for DfT, this package *only* can be used to make the TRA25 road traffic quarterly tables. It is true that this will prove a useful package to those in DfT looking to RAP tables themselves (see [below](#notSRF)).

## "I'm stuck... help!"
If you are having problems with this package, there are different places you can find help:

* Read all of this document
* Look at other documentation: `xltabr` is better documented(!)
* Google (it can't hurt) - especially if your problem is likely a problem with R coding
* [Raise an issue](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/ac-roadtraff-pipe/issues) on GitHub if you have found a bug within this package
* Email me: lukefshaw@gmail.com

## TRA25rap - what is it?

This purpose of this package is to help users present beautifully formatted Excel tables in the DfT standard format. This package can automate the entire table making process, as shown in the image below. Part of why this is so powerful is that it is exactly repeatable, once the code is written all that is needed is an update to the data and then just re-run!

This will act as a segment of the [pipeline dream](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/) for transforming the way that official statistics are produced. 

This package is a [TRA25](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/tra25-quarterly-estimates)-tailored version of xltabr, including all the functions and code that I (Luke Shaw) wrote and developed - all focused primarily around `xltabr`. 

## <c name="SRF2"></c> "I'm in the Road Stats team and I want to make new TRA25 tables"

Great! You'll need to install the package onto your desktop and have R set up on the system. 

(Note that there should be a set of Desk Notes to guide you through in more detail)

Then, you need to read through and run the script "TRA25_run_script.R" that is in the "exec" folder of this package. You can open it in RStudio by the usual file finder way or by running:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.edit(system.file("exec", "TRA25_run_script.R", package="TRA25rap"))
```
Or, if you're running ON the ETHOS network you should instead use:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.edit(system.file("exec", "TRA25_run_script_on_network.R", package="TRA25rap"))
```

in your console which will open the file. Make sure you read all the comments, and without any hiccups you should have the tables ready in under 5 minutes! As this package is not fully developed and released, do not be afraid of hiccups...

The Desk Notes, which should have the bespoke ETHOS issues that may occur, are currently the definitive document for making the tables each quarter.

## <b name="notSRF"></b> "I'm in DfT, but not trying to produce table set TRA25... and I am thinking of getting into RAPping"

Great! Depending on how "heavy" an R-user you are may affect how much you want to use my package.

I have chosen here as the place to discuss useful resources when taking on a project like this:

* **USE THE RAP COMPANION** which is available [online](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/). A lot of the pitfalls and ultimately missed scope of this project were due to not closely following the RAP companion, and instead focussing on every individual problem that I wanted to solve - as opposed on whether it should be solved and thinking about time constraints and outputs. 

* I should have learnt to be [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) but I was too blinkered. Similarly, for those starting out for the first time I recommend looking into [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps#Definitions_and_history) as a way of working/thinking.

* Be a member of the [Gov Data Science Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com), specifically the channel #rap_collaboration which will be invaluable. 

* Use the [RAP R MOOC](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) which *I should have been using the whole time*, but wasn't aware of when I started as well as not knowing how much it could have helped me. Hindsight is 20/20!

* Government is already RAP-ping all over the place, **do not** go off on a solo mission to prove your coding prowess: use all the help and tools already out there.


If the tables you are trying to produce are wildly different to the ones I have created with this package, you may not find any of my sub-functions useful. If you are comfortable with R, having a look at my functions may prove inspirational for building your own.

I would suggest reading all of the [`xltabr` readme](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/xltabr/) to understand what this is about. Then, when writing your scripts use the DfT Style Path document in this package, which you can get in 2 ways:

1. Download my package and then in your script where the table is made run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
xltabr::set_style_path(system.file("DfT_styles.xlsx", package = "TRA25rap"))
```
2. Go to the 'inst' folder of this package's GitHub and download "DfT_styles.xlsx" and then:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
xltabr::set_style_path("/whereyousavedit/.../DfT_styles.xlsx")
```

This ensures that DfT_styles can act as a master document for DfT-formatted tables, and as such we have no inconsistencies with font style, size, and colourings.

## <a name="inst"></a> Installation
This document assumes you have an understanding of coding in RStudio.

Installing the most up-to-date version of this package can be done inside R, *IF* you are working off-network (eg on a laptop):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#1) first be logged in to departmentfortransport private repo
#2) in browser, go to github/settings/tokens
#3) set up token - scope 'repo'
#copy token and use that in auth_token argument

library(devtools) #devtools has to be installed first
devtools::install_github(repo = "departmentfortransport/ac-roadtraff-pipe"
                         ,auth_token = "copyinyournewflashytoken")
library(TRA25rap)
```

If you are working on the network, the Desk Instructions document detail a way to make the package work.

## Example

This is an example of the power of this package - it can reproduce and update tables through the simple updating of the data in its raw format online.


First, ensure the package is in the Environment. Note you would have to have installed the package first (see [above](#inst) - only needs to be done once per desktop).

```{r library}
library(TRA25rap) 
```

```{r, echo = F}
load("~/ac-roadtraff-pipe/R/sysdata.rda")
```

Second, download the raw data from online. 
```{r, eval = F}
#Note: currently (Sep 2018) the API is not in use 
raw <- TRA25_data_api("https://statistics-api.dft.gov.uk/api/roadtraffic/quarterly") 
```
```{r getdata}
head(raw)
```
If your data is in a csv on your desktop you can get it into R easily, an example of how to do that is given at http://rprogramming.net/read-csv-in-r/ 

There are 2 steps to outputting nice Excel tables from raw data:  
1. rearrange the data into correct shape  
2. create the Excel table (including headers, footers, formatting etc.)  

####Step 1 - rearranging the data
We can format the data as desired, which for sheet TRA2501a in table TRA2501 is:
rolling annual vehicle miles split into different vehicle types. Using the bespoke function `TRA25_arrange_data` this means simply one line of code specifying each decision: 

```{r example1}
data_for_xl <- TRA25_arrange_data(raw, roll=T, type="vehicle", units="traffic", km_or_miles = "miles")
head(data_for_xl)
```

####Step 2 - format into a lovely Excel Sheet
Now the data is in the right shape for making the table. After naming the title and footer this is all done inside the `TRA25_format_to_xl` function:

```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
###TRA2501a####
title_text <- c("Department for Transport statistics",
                "Traffic",
                "Table TRA2501a",
                "Road traffic (vehicle miles) by vehicle type in Great Britain, rolling annual totals from 1994",
                "",
                "Billion vehicle miles")
footer_text <- c("Other = Two wheeled motor vehicles, buses, and coaches",
                 "Note Total column may not match sum due to rounding",
                 "(3) Figures affected by September 2000 fuel protest",
                 "(4) 2001 figures affected by the impact of Foot and Mouth disease",
                 "(5) Affected by heavy snowfall",
                 "P Provisional",
                 "Telephone: 020 7944 3095",
                 "Email: roadtraff.stats@dft.gov.uk",
                 "The figures in this table are National Statistics",
                 "",
                 "Source: DfT National Road Traffic Survey",
                 "Last updated: November 2017",
                 "Next update: May 2018")

TRA25_format_to_xl(data_for_xl,
       title_text,
       footer_text,
       table_name = "TRA2501a")
```
The above process can be repeated for each sheet in the Excel file, and by the end you will have the finished table. There is a way to append the sheet to a workbook, which is how I have made the TRA25 series. The Contents pages are the templates I use (all contained within this package) and then each sheet can be bolted on to the file. To see this in action, see the "TRA25_run_script.R" script in this package, which can be found by running:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
file.edit(system.file("exec", "TRA25_run_script.R", package="TRA25rap"))
```
